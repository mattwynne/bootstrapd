  <h1>The Schedule</h1>
  <p>
    Bootstrapd will be an open-space event on the day, but we'd like to see most
    of the brainstorming and decision-making about topics and sessions happen
    beforehand, via the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bootstrapd">mailing list</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The conference will begin at 9am with lightning talks from
    everyone who wants to lead a session, then we'll build a first draft of the
    programme as post-it notes on a whiteboard. Participants will be encouraged to continue to
    modify the programme throughout the day.
  </p>
  <p>
    There will be three tracks and five session slots, making a total
    of 15 sessions. Throughout the day there will be one or two more rounds of
    lightening talks, just to stir up the mix and maybe generate new
    ideas for sessions during the day.
