If you're coming to the conference, you are welcome to edit the site yourself!

### How to edit the site

There are three ways you can make changes to this website:

1. Ideally, use Github's [pull request](http://help.github.com/send-pull-requests/) feature to submit a patch.
2. If pull requests are not your thing, or you'd like to discuss the change before you make it, just [start a new thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!newtopic/bootstrapd) on the [google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/bootstrapd).
