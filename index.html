  <h3>I'm very busy you know! What makes bootstrapd special?</h3>
  <p>
  We're organising this conference simply because we're trying to bootstrap our own product businesses, and we'd like to spend a day with other people who are in the same boat. Bootstrapping can be lonely at times, and we believe that creating a support network where we can share ideas and lessons learned will give us all a massive boost.
  </p>
  <p>
  We believe great spaces can inspire great thinking, so we've carefully chosen a special venue in the heart of Edinburgh: a grand old baronial mansion with breathtaking, unrestricted views of Arthur's Seat from the private gardens.</p>
  <p>
  <p>
  Bootstrapping is all about taking initiative, so we're deliberately hosting this as an open space, where delegates decide the programme and propose and run sessions that are relevant to them. We'll facilitate the event to ensure it runs smoothly, but the content is up to all of us. Every open space we've been too has been a terrific experience.
  </p>
  Making a profit has nothing to do with our goal for this event. Any surplus revenue will go behind the bar.
