  <h3>I'm very busy you know! What makes bootstrapd special?</h3>
  <p>
  We're organising this conference simply because we're trying to bootstrap our own product businesses, and we'd like to spend a day with other people who are in the same boat. Bootstrapping can be lonely at times, and we believe that creating a support network where we can share ideas and lessons learned will give us all a massive boost.
  </p>
  <p>
  We believe great spaces can inspire great thinking, so we've carefully chosen a special venue in the heart of Edinburgh: a grand old baronial mansion with breathtaking, unrestricted views of Arthur's Seat from the private gardens.</p>
  <p>
  <p>
  Bootstrapping is all about taking initiative, so we're deliberately hosting this as an open space, where <a href="/schedule.html">delegates decide the programme and propose and run sessions that are relevant to them</a>. We'll facilitate the event to ensure it runs smoothly, but the content is up to all of us. Every open space we've been to has been a terrific experience.
  </p>
  Making a profit has nothing to do with our goal for this event. Any surplus revenue will go behind the bar.
